# GRAS
Graphical Representation of Assembly Sequencing

A proof of concept for a novel new way to plan automated assembly, as outline in the paper. 

To test clone files in GRAS Workspace 2.0 and run GRASWORKSPACE ~m in Matlab.

This is an unfinished proejct and requires use of GA or similar heuristic to plan the route and provide efficiency score for assembly so that part complexity and acess etc can be reconsidered.
